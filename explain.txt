## Script Breakdown

### Line-by-Line Explanation

**Line 1: `#!/bin/bash`**
* This line specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash interpreter.

**Line 2: `file_name="$1"`**
* This line assigns the first command-line argument to the variable `file_name`. `$1` represents the first argument passed to the script.

**Line 3: `new_line="$2"`**
* Similar to line 2, this line assigns the second command-line argument to the variable `new_line`. `$2` represents the second argument.

**Line 4: `if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then`**
* This line starts an `if` condition.
* `$#` represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the script.
* `-ne` is a comparison operator for "not equal to".
* So, this condition checks if the number of arguments is not equal to 2.

**Line 5: `  echo "Usage: $0 file_name new_line"`**
* This line is indented to indicate it's part of the `if` block.
* If the condition on line 4 is true (i.e., the number of arguments is not 2), this line prints a usage message showing how to correctly use the script. `$0` represents the script name itself.

**Line 6: `  exit 1`**
* This line also belongs to the `if` block.
* If the condition on line 4 is true, the script exits with an error code of 1, indicating an error.

**Line 7: `fi`**
* This line ends the `if` block.

**Line 8: `if [ ! -f "$file_name" ]; then`**
* This line starts another `if` condition.
* `!` is the negation operator.
* `-f` is a file test operator that checks if a file exists and is a regular file.
* So, this condition checks if the file specified by `file_name` does not exist.

**Line 9: `  echo "File '$file_name' does not exist."`**
* If the file doesn't exist, this line prints an error message.

**Line 10: `  exit 1`**
* If the file doesn't exist, the script exits with an error code of 1.

**Line 11: `fi`**
* This line ends the second `if` block.

**Line 12: `echo "$new_line" >> "$file_name"`**
* This line appends the content of the `new_line` variable to the end of the file specified by `file_name`. The `>>` operator is used for appending.

### Summary
This script checks if two command-line arguments are provided, and if so, it checks if the first argument (a file name) exists. If both conditions are met, it appends the second argument (the new line) to the specified file. Otherwise, it displays an error message and exits.
